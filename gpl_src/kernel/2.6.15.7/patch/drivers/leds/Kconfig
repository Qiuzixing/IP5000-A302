config NEW_LEDS
	bool "LED Support"
	help
	  Say Y to enable Linux LED support.  This allows control of supported
	  LEDs from both userspace and optionally, by kernel events (triggers).

	  This is not related to standard keyboard LEDs which are controlled
	  via the input system.

config LEDS_CLASS
	tristate "LED Class Support"
	depends NEW_LEDS
	help
	  This option enables the led sysfs class in /sys/class/leds.  You'll
	  need this to do anything useful with LEDs.  If unsure, say N.

config LEDS_S3C24XX
	tristate "LED Support for Samsung S3C24XX GPIO LEDs"
	depends on LEDS_CLASS && ARCH_S3C2410
	help
	  This option enables support for LEDs connected to GPIO lines
	  on Samsung S3C24XX series CPUs, such as the S3C2410 and S3C2440.

config LEDS_AST1500
	tristate "LED Support for AST1500 GPIO LEDs"
	help
	  This option enables support for LEDs connected to GPIO lines
	  on AST1500.

comment "LED Triggers"

config LEDS_TRIGGERS
	bool "LED Trigger support"
	depends NEW_LEDS
	help
	  This option enables trigger support for the leds class.
	  These triggers allow kernel events to drive the LEDs and can
	  be configured via sysfs. If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_TIMER
	tristate "LED Timer Trigger"
	depends LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by a programmable timer
	  via sysfs. If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_HEARTBEAT
	tristate "LED Heartbeat Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by a CPU load average.
	  The flash frequency is a hyperbolic function of the 1-minute
	  load average.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_PUSHBUTTON
	tristate "GPIO Push Button Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This is a tricky implementation to use GPIO Push Button
	  through the LED class framework.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_SWITCH
	tristate "GPIO Switch Trigger"
	default y
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This is a tricky implementation to use GPIO Switch
	  through the LED class framework.
